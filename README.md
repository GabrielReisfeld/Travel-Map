# Pin Travel Map :round_pushpin:
App where you pin your location anywhere in the world and leave a review from the place for other users.

You have to register and login, and then create a pin where you put a title, description and a rating from the place. And it will have the information from who created and when it was created.

### MERN Stack :rocket:
*The app was made in the Frontend with React.js, using Functional Components and Hooks, and Material-UI for the styles. The Backend was made with Node.js and Express. And MongoDB and Mongoose for the Database.*
